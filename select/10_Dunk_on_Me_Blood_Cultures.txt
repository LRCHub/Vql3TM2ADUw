They didn't tell me I could stop
From tearing myself back apart

They don't know you like I do
Know you like I do
They don't know you like I do, like I try to

They don't know you like I do
(They don't know just who you are)
They don't know you like

They don't know you like I do
(They don't know just who you are)
Cause I want to

(If it hadn't been for you)

I wait up for you after dark
Now I'm staring at your parked car

They don't know you like I do
Know you like I do
They don't know you like I do, like I try to

They don't know you like I do
(They don't know just who you are)
Know you like I do

They don't know you like I do
(They don't know just who you are)
Cause I want to

They don't know you like I do
(They don't know just who you are)
They don't know you

They don't know you like I do
(They don't know just who you are)
Because I want to

They don't know you like I do
Know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
Like I want to
