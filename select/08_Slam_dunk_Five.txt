Five bad boys with the power to rock you
Blowing your mind so you gotta get into
Five, whatcha waiting
Four, if you wanna
Three, two, one, let's do it

Do you wanna get freaky?
When the five of us make one
You gotta push the good vibe on
If you really wanna feel it
Got da flava in my soul
But I really need to know (bam, give it up)

Do you wanna get down?
Do you wanna get funky?
Do you wanna get down?
Get on down

Slam dunk da funk, put it up (if you got that feeling)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (put it up)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (if you got that feeling)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (put it up)

You gotta shoot, pass, slam, baby, time to set it off
I'll be up, up away, above the rim and hook a shot
Alley-oop, baby, whoomp, there it is and now I got ya
Three seconds left, it's just enough for me to rock ya
Now check it, how I flip it rock a beat 'cause I get with it
Yo, and everybody wants to be the man
With a hey, yippee-yo, yippee, four quarter slam
Everybody grab a party and just get on down

Do you wanna get down?
Do you wanna get funky?
Do you wanna get down?
Get on down

Slam dunk da funk, put it up (if you got that feeling)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (put it up)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (if you got that feeling)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (put it up)

By now you wanna know what hits you like a fork-lift truck
We got J, AB, Rich, Sean and Scott
Rocking the extra (curricular), ladies love (particular)
Fellas who knock da meter get the boom, shake, regular
Five bad boys, honey, no we don't quit
'Til we hit the rebound sound with a kick
So come on everybody, everybody in tune
As I boom, shake 'n rock a booty, gimme room, ha

Clap your hands, move your feet
Push it in, pull it out to the beat
Clap your hands, move your feet
Push it in, pull it out to the beat (give it up)

Slam dunk da funk, put it up (if you got that feeling)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (put it up)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (if you got that feeling)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (put it up)

Slam dunk da funk, put it up (do you wanna get funky?)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (get on down)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (if you got that feeling)
Slam dunk da funk, put it up (get on down)
