Momma looking good in some jeans all ripped
Got a baby in her belly and a baby on her hip
Little toe headed rascal peeing off the porch
Daddy got a shotgun looking for a stork
Oh lord

And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you in, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o-o, po-Dunk

Bible by the bed and a bottle sitting pretty
Pigskin on the TV, bacon in a skillet
An old mutt in the yard lickin on an itch
Bunch of fake flamingos flocking by the bitch
(Can I get a witness?)

And that's po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
A yard full of chickens and a bar full of drunks
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you in, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o-o, po-Dunk

Po-dunk!

Put your adult beverage over your head
If you're bat shit crazy and your neck is red
As the dirt on the road where we all grew up
Sing something with me if you ain't nothing but
(You ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but, you ain't nothing but)

Po-dunk
Don't give a flying hillbilly fuck
I said po-dunk
House full of youngins and a yard full of junk
Love us if you can, sorry if you can't
Holla if you in, shut up if you ain't
Po-o-o-o-o
Po-o-o-o-o, po-Dunk
Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!
Po-Dunk!
